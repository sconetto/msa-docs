# About HR Project Interfaces

Some of HR Project services are built with an API format (Application Programming Interface), due to this technology and the need to document comprehensively the interfaces the [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) language was chosen to document these systems.

This way we can write the blueprint in the chosen language format and easily transform it into markdown documents (that are part of this system), making them easy to write, to update and to deploy.

The following interfaces are documented in the API Blueprint format:

- [Interface - Auth API](./api-auth)
- [Interface - Paycheck API](./api-paycheck)
- [Interface - Register API](./api-register)
- [Interface - Vacation API](./api-vacation)
