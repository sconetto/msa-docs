# MSA Docs Study Case: HR System

This study case contains the HR System documentation, which is a fictional human resources system focused on payroll features of the MARVEL[^1] organization.
In MARVEL, the human resources area is subdivided into three main areas: registration and maintenance of functional records, payment and benefits to employees, and personnel development.

Despite this focus on payroll, the system has features of the employees registering domain to allow the registration of the employees that will be considered in MARVEL's organization payroll.
For the system user, the system has two macro requirements:

1. To function as HR management system, and;

2. Allow integration of other systems with the data managed on the system.

This is a web-based system built on the **Microservice Architecture**, consisting of various services and user interfaces, as described in this documentation.
Despite this modularization, the system is viewed by the user as a single software, so that the modularization is not perceived.
