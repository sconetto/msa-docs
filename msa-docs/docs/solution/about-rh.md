# About HR Project

The Human Resources system is a project for building a human resource management system for MARVEL[^1] organization.
It has functionalities to register employee data, their vacations and their payments, as well as to consult all this data.
For the system user, the system has two macro requirements:

1. To function as HR management system, and;

2. Allow integration of other systems with the data managed on the system.

This is a web-based system built on the **Microservice Architecture**, consisnting of various services and _interfaces_, as described in this documentation.
Despite this modularization, the system is viewed by the user as a single software, so that the modularization is not perceived.
